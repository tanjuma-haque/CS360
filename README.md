Machine Learning (Fall 2019)

This repo has all the labs we are doing as part of our Machine Learning course. 

Taken from the course website: "In this course, we will explore both classical and modern approaches, with an emphasis on 
theoretical understanding. There will be a significant math component (statistics and probability in particular), as well 
as a substantial implementation component (as opposed to using high-level libraries)."
